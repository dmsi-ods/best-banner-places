# Best Banner Places Data Science for Social Good Project
## Description
Imagine that STA Travel (the world's largest student and youth travel company) has decided to advertise with the help of banners and turned to us for this. To test whether such banners are great, they will place only 20 pieces around the world. We need to choose 20 such locations, so that the benefits were great and the company continued to cooperate with us.

The company is large, and it has several offices around the world. Locations should be near these offices (it's easier to negotiate and check the result). Also these places should be popular among tourists.

To find the best places use the database of the largest network based on locations - Foursquare. Part of the open data is on the site archive.org: https://archive.org/details/201309_foursquare_dataset_umn
